- Hi, I am @edKotinsky and I am interesting in electronics, Arduino and C++ programming (I'm interesting in a lot of things, but here it is not important)
- I speak a little English and I study (do not laugh at me if I don't understand or I am wrong, and I will be thankful if you tell me about my mistakes)
- How to reach me: https://vk.com/dudewhodied or mrkotofey@inbox.ru
